# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-learning

Features
Deep Learning Models: We employ cutting-edge deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately detect plant diseases.
Multi-Class Classification: DeepGreen can classify plant diseases into multiple categories, allowing for comprehensive analysis and targeted treatment.
Image Preprocessing: The project includes preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of input images, ensuring better model performance.
Scalability: DeepGreen is designed to handle large datasets and can scale effectively to accommodate additional classes and types of plant diseases.
Easy-to-Use Interface: Our system provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and obtaining quick diagnosis results.


Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset of plant images, annotated with various diseases. You can find more information about the dataset in the data/ directory.
